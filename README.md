# LGR-Theme
An LGR Theme for Windows 95 and Above*


**READ ME FOR THE WINDOWS 98 LGR THEME**
This read me was made in notepad on win98, as was the theme :)

NOTICE:
This theme is high color. If you only have 256 colors it may not look right, in which case sorry. :(

HOW TO USE:
Just type in where you have plus installed with themes\ added on the end! (The default location though, C:\Program Files\Plus!\ is also the
default in the installer. :) )
(Note: The Plus! Folder is installed with themes by Windows, so if you didn't install Plus! but did install themes, it's already there. :) )

EXTRA:
If you don't have a 4:3 Monitor:
Figure out the ratio for you're monitor (say 1:1), then either take image equally of the top and bottom or sides until it fits you're screen.
For this purpose a Non-Corrected image has been included. This is the original image I got before making it 4:3.
